# Python Rule-Based Chatbot 🤖💬

This project is a simple yet effective **rule-based chatbot** built using Python.  
It uses regular expressions for pattern matching and NumPy for random response selection.  
The chatbot can greet, answer basic questions, and respond interactively through a command-line interface.
